# ‚ú® Strategic B2B Sales Expert

Hey there! I'm combining my 15+ years of international B2B experience with the latest AI tools to create a modern sales approach that actually works. No fluff, just results.

## üöÄ What's This All About?

I'm blending what I already do well (connecting with people and closing deals) with what machines do well (analyzing data and automating repetitive tasks). The result? More time for what matters in sales - understanding clients and solving their problems.

I combine an enthusiastic, light communication style with proven deal-closing effectiveness - that sweet spot between building genuine rapport and driving business outcomes.

## üí° My Approach in a Nutshell

- **Consultative Selling**: Advanced discovery techniques but without the corporate speak
- **Value Storytelling**: Making ROI tangible through real-world examples, not just spreadsheets
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Breaking down silos between sales, marketing, and product
- **AI-Enhanced Efficiency**: Letting the robots handle the boring stuff while I focus on what matters
- **Modern Presentations**: Using tools like Gamma to create stories, not slides

## üõ†Ô∏è Cool Tools I'm Using

- Gamma & Beautiful.ai for presentations that don't put people to sleep
- Jasper AI & Claude/ChatGPT for content that sounds like a human wrote it
- Salesforce & LinkedIn Navigator for finding the right people and staying organized
- HubSpot for seamless marketing-to-sales pipeline optimization
- Obsidian & GitHub for keeping my knowledge base actually useful
