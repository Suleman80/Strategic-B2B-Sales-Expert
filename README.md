# ‚ú® Strategic B2B Sales Expert

Hey there! I'm leveraging my 15+ years of international B2B experience with the latest AI tools to create a modern sales approach that actually works. No fluff, just results.

## üöÄ What's This All About?

I transform siloed departments into unified growth engines by connecting sales strategy with marketing insights and product capabilities. My approach frees up time for what truly matters in sales - understanding clients and solving their business problems. 

I bring together an enthusiastic, light communication style with proven deal-closing effectiveness - that sweet spot between building genuine rapport and driving measurable business outcomes.

## üí° My Approach in a Nutshell

- **Consultative Selling**: Advanced discovery techniques but without the corporate speak
- **Value Storytelling**: Making ROI tangible through real-world examples, not just spreadsheets
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration (RevOps)**: Breaking down silos between sales, marketing, and product
- **AI-Enhanced Efficiency**: Letting the AI tools make the entire sales process smoother and more effective
- **Modern Presentations**: Using tools like Gamma to create stories, not slides

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Tools I'm Using

- **HubSpot** for RevOps excellence and aligning marketing with sales processes
- **AI Assistants** (Claude/ChatGPT) for enhancing client communications and automating research
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** for strategic account insights and engagement
- **Modern Presentation Tools** (Gamma/Beautiful.ai) for creating compelling value stories
- **Knowledge Management** (Obsidian/GitHub) for documenting frameworks and best practices
